1. uVision2 Integrated Development Environment

uVision2 is an IDE that encapsulates a project manager, make facility, tool
configuration, editor and a powerful debugger.  You use uVision2 to write
and compile your programs using our tools.  The example programs provided
are designed to work with uVision2.


2. Example Programs and First Steps

When you create a new project you have to select a Device from the device
database.  However we provide also some sample projects which are located
in the folders \C51\EXAMPLES and \C166\EXAMPLES.  

HELLO    is a simple program which prints the string "Hello World" via the
         Serial I/O Interface of the 166 derivative

MEASURE  Data acquisition system for analog and digital systems.

DHRY     is the Dhrystone Benchmark.

WHETS    is the Single Precision Whetstone Benchmark.

To generate an application:
a)  Select Project - Open Project:  i.e.  C166\examples\hello\hello.uv2
b)  Project - Rebuild all target files or Build target

To create an own application:
a)  Project - New Project:  select a directory and enter project file
b)  Project - Select Device:  select an 8051, 166, or ST10 device
c)  Project - Targets, Groups, Files:  Add/Files, select Source Group1 and
    add the source files.
d)  Project - Options:  set all the tool options (the defaults are typically
    good settings for first projects, just add the external memory devices
    you are using).
e)  Project - Rebuild all target files or Build target

To debug the application:
a)  Debug - Debugger:  start Debugger
b)  Use Step toolbar buttons or enter in Output Window - Command:  G, main
c)  You can open the Serial Window using the Toolbar "Serial #1" button.
d)  Now you can debug your program with standard options: Step, Go, Break.
